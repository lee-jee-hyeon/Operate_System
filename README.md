Matrix multiplication with multi-process.

# Analysis of Problem #

1. The parent process is not involved in the work, and the child process is assigned the same weight
By assigning work, the multiplication operation of matrices must be performed, (weight and method of allocation of matrices)

2. How to process data should be coded according to the program intention.

3. Focus on improving accessibility and memory and performance on how to allocate multiple processors
should match..

4. How do we assign work to matrices A and C? (Selecting the FILE read time point)
